PIGGIES - A GAME OF CHANCE AND GREED
Game Objective: first to reach 100 points (or more wins)

The Rules: Each player, in his turn, gets as many throws of a dice as he wishes. The amount of players is potentially unlimited (we recommend up to 4 players for an enjoyable and short gameplay). Any time you throw the dice, the number that appears is the number of points you get (only 2-6 will give you point, continue to read for more instructions). A turn can end if one of two things happen: The player wants to stop his turn - In that case, he gets all the points he accumulated during the current turn.

If the dice rolls on 1 - In that case, all the points he accumulated during his current turn are lost, and the turn moves to the next player.

The points that A player has already got are his and he can not lose them For example: if he already had 22 points from previous rounds but rolled a 1. His turn simply ends and the score count remains on 22. If A player had 22 points from previous turns and in the current turn he got 15 more points but chose to roll again and rolled A 1, his point count will drop to 22 and not to 0.

How should you use the game board
Once you have chosen how many players are playing the game, you should start the game by hitting the start button

In the game, each time you are clicking the roll button the cube will dice randomly, you will have 4 seconds to see what is the number you got, then the dice will return to the default position of 1 for letting you know that you can dice again.

Remember that if you didn't see the number which you got from your roll, you will see the points you got in your player profile, (if it is zero, you got one).

p.s if you have heard a snort sound, it means you are a pig!!! ;)

Good Luck!!!
